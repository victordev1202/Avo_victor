# Avocado
The missing Ruby on Rails admin

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'avocado'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install avocado
```

## Contributing

```
git clone
cd avocado
bundle install
bin/rails server
```

You may also use the VSCode launcher to take advantage of the debugger.

You may need to run `rake db:migrate && rake db:test:prepare` for local development.

To start the Webpack dev server you need to have a different seesion running `bin/webpack-dev-server`
